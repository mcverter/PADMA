Set Cache-Control header in your main page.

<?php
header('Cache-Control: max-age=900');
?>

Using Post/Redirect/Get rule you can avoid this.

This problem will arise by the following.

Let say i have example1.php example2.php & example3.php
I am posting some value from example1.php to example2.php then i did all the DB stuff as per my need and rendered the page (Not Redirected - Just posted and the page got rendered).
After submitting values from example2.php to sometest.php and I have redirected the page to example3.php. Now if you click browser back Document will Expire.

To Avoid this we can post the values from example1.php to some other php and then we need to Redirect the user to example2.php

This is Post/Redirect/Get pattern that every web developer must follow to avoid document expire. It also helps avoid redundant entry in DB.
