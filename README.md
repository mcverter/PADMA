History of the Project
======================

PADMA was written by a graduate student from between 2008-2010.
A professor originally asked to make a minor modification to the permissions settings on a few pages, which I did quickly.  

I was then asked to redesign the style of the site.  However, I could not make sense of the spaghetti code which the previous coder has written,
so I found it hard to redesign.  This project had a few false starts:  initially, I just tried to hack the css, then I tried to modularize the html somewhat,
but only in September was able to begin in earnest to redesign everything from scratch.

The end users did not communicate any requirements to me, so I did my best to reverse engineer the code, 
trying to figure out what the graduate student had been trying to do with such a complicated code base.  
The more I struggled with the code, however, the more I realized that the complexity of the code had more
to do with the skill of the previous designer than the requirements of the task.

Due to the nature of this task, this repository includes both the original codebase and the redesign.
